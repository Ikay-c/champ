***What is a Chatbot?***
A chatbot is simply an automated device that recieves simulations in terms of voice and text from a user, processes it and carry out that which it was told to do.
It can also mean an intelligent device that serves the interest of a user by receiving a command through the user's voice and text, process and carry it out.

***Chatbot Mechanism***
Before a chatbot can work properly, it needs to be first trained on how best to receive simulations. 
Due to the fact that there are different kinds of chatbot which varies in their capacity to respond to a user, the mechanism differs. 
1. **Rule based chatbot**
This kind of chatbot is a sort of bot-to-user and the bot works based on a programmed template. It cannot answer or reply a request outside the template, that is, it either reply the user with another answer because it does not have an exact reply.
2. **Intelligent chatbot**
This kind of chat bot, upon receiving a request or command, first tries to understand the request with the help of the _natural language understanding (NLU)._ Which tries to come up with series of related answers in form of a question. This act is to help the bot understand better, the intention of the user, thereby, expanding its horizon too. 
3. **AI based chatbot**
This kind of chatbot is a combination of the previously discussed chatbots. It receives simulation from the user, first understand it with the help of the NLU, processes it with the help of the _Natural language processing (NLP)_. If beyond its programmed intelligence, seeks the help of a third party which is a person, then responds the user. 
This kind of chatbot, through the NLP, operates by sentiments(studies the user's motives based on experience and sends to the third party whenever necessary,  normalization(checkmates spelling errors), named entity reecognition(compares the user's info, and the background of the request to its answers) and dependency parsing (compare the key words in the user's text with its answers to determine the kind of suitable answer).

In general, a chatbot is an application that converse with a human and helps solve some personal questions.
